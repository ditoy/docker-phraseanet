## How to use this image

As this image only contains PHP FPM and the application, the easiest way to use it, is to run it with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for which we provide a [sample compose file](https://github.com/netresearch/docker-phraseanet/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with nginx, mariab and redis:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ditoy/docker-phraseanet.git
cd docker-phraseanet
docker-compose up -d
```
See the `.env` file for the default environment variables.

## Environment variables

### ADMIN_EMAIL

The administrators email (defaults to `phrasea@example.com`).

## Issues

We built this image to quickly try out Phraseanet - however we're not actually using it and thus don't provide any support for it. Though we're open to merge in pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/netresearch/docker-phraseanet) to update this image.
